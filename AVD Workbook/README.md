## üìä Data Collection Scope

### Automatic Discovery & Configuration
- ‚úÖ **AVD Host Pools** - All host pools in the subscription
- ‚úÖ **Storage Accounts** - Accounts tagged with 'AVD' or containing 'avd', 'profile', 'fslogix' in name
- ‚úÖ **Azure NetApp Files** - All ANF accounts, pools, and volumes
- ‚úÖ **Session Hosts** - Performance counters and event logs via Data Collection Rules

### Performance Counters Collected
- Disk I/O metrics (reads, writes, queue length, latency)
- Memory utilization and committed bytes
- CPU usage and processor queue length
- Network interface statistics
- Terminal Services session counts
- User Profile Service metrics

| where InstanceName contains "Profile"
| summarize AvgFreeMB = avg(CounterValue) by Computer
```

```kql
// FSLogix profile load times

```

## üéØ ANF Sizing Recommendations

The analytics provide data-driven recommendations for:

### Performance Tiers
- **Standard** - Light usage scenarios (< 16 MiB/s per TB)
- **Premium** - Production workloads (64 MiB/s per TB)  
- **Ultra** - High-performance requirements (128 MiB/s per TB)

### Capacity Planning
- Base capacity requirements from profile size analysis
- Growth projections based on historical data
- Peak load capacity for concurrent user scenarios
- Burst capacity recommendations for profile loading

### Network Considerations
- Bandwidth requirements between session hosts and ANF
- Latency requirements for optimal user experience
- Subnet planning for ANF delegation

## üîí Security & Compliance

| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where ObjectName in ("LogicalDisk", "Memory", "Processor")
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), CounterName, Computer
```

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: No data appearing in Log Analytics**
- Wait 15-30 minutes after deployment
- Verify diagnostic settings are enabled on AVD resources
- Check that session hosts have the Azure Monitor Agent installed

**Q: Storage accounts not being monitored**
- Ensure storage accounts are tagged with 'AVD' or contain 'avd', 'profile', or 'fslogix' in the name
- Verify permissions on storage accounts

**Q: ANF volumes not showing data**
- Confirm Azure NetApp Files are present in the subscription
- Verify ANF diagnostic settings were created successfully

### Getting Help

1. **Check deployment logs** in the Azure portal under Resource Group > Deployments
2. **Review diagnostic settings** on individual AVD resources
3. **Validate Log Analytics workspace** permissions and configuration
4. **Open an issue** in this GitHub repository with deployment details
